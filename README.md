# Convolutional Model Application

This project applies a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into different categories, using transfer learning and high-level deep learning frameworks.  
It is part of **Week 1 (Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks)** from the **Deep Learning Specialization** by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera.

##  Description

In this lab, I used a pretrained CNN model to classify real-world images into predefined classes.  
This project demonstrates how pretrained models, feature extraction, and simple modifications can be used to solve practical computer vision problems without training a network from scratch.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Transfer learning using a pretrained CNN
- Feature extraction for image classification
- Loading and preprocessing image datasets
- Forward pass and prediction using deep models
- Visualizing and interpreting predictions

##  Files Included

- `convolution_model_application.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for applying a pretrained CNN
- `cnn_app_utils.py`: Helper functions for loading models, preprocessing, and prediction
- `images/`: Contains input images for classification
